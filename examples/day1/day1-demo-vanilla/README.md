# Day 1 JS Concepts Demo (Vanilla)

A tiny, zero-build demo app you can run in class to show Day 1 concepts.

## Run

### Option A: Python HTTP server

```bash
cd day1-demo-vanilla
python3 -m http.server 5173
```

Open: http://localhost:5173

### Option B: Any static server

Serve this folder and open `index.html`.

## Teaching flow (recommended)

1) Promises: resolve/reject/then/catch
2) async/await: try/catch, sequential vs parallel
3) async-in-map trap + Promise.all
4) Then quickly demo the other core JS concepts as time allows.

Each demo card shows:
- what to say (teacher note)
- what students should observe
